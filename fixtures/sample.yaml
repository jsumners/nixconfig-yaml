step1:  &id001                  # defines anchor label &id001
  instrument:      Lasik 2000
  pulseEnergy:     5.4
  pulseDuration:   12
  repetition:      1000
  spotSize:        1mm

step2: &id002
  instrument:      Lasik 2000
  pulseEnergy:     5.0
  pulseDuration:   10
  repetition:      500
  spotSize:        2mm

step3: *id001                   # refers to the first step (with anchor &id001)
step4: *id002                   # refers to the second step
step5:
  <<: *id001
  spotSize: 2mm                # redefines just this key, refers rest from &id001
step6: *id002
